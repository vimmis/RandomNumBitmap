# RandomNumBitmap

This is a NodeJS project with hardly a few src files.

To run,
npm install from the project directory having package.json

node app.js

now open browser localhost on port 3000. 

NOTE:
Assumption: for 128x128 pixel image, 128x128  numbers are achieved from the API between 0 and 255 as values for RGB.

Please note, the Random ORg has very limited Qouta, hence to generate 128x128 pixel data, the Qouta usually get full easily and
I went from 3 hours to 6 hours to complete it, eventually with a sample array of data in test.html

Please comment "res.sendPage("home.html")" and uncomment "res.sendPage("test.html")" from app.js to make it work incase of qouta issues.
